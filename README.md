# Snake-Game-using-pygame
This is a classic snake game made using python's pygame module.After running the code press spacebar to play.\
Then navigate the snake(white pixel) to the food(red pixel) by using either arrow  keys or "wsad" keys.\
In this version of the game you will lose if u hit a wall or eat yourself(hard mode) but i have added the code(as comments from line 168-183) for easy mode too in which you can only die by eating yourself.\
If you are intersted in easy mode you can make a pull request and add these modes to the game.

For installing pygame module:\
try typing: pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame(if first one dosen't work) in your terminal
